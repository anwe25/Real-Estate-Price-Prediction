##  Project Overview

This project walks through the entire process of building a machine learning model to predict housing prices. It includes:

- **Data preprocessing & exploration** — Understanding and visualizing housing features.
- **Model training & evaluation** — Comparing multiple algorithms and tuning hyperparameters.
- **Model persistence** — Saving and reusing trained models with **joblib**.
- **Usage examples** — Step-by-step guide on how to deploy the model for predictions.
